						As a <b>Researcher</b>, I would like to delve into the world of birding accessibility.<br>

						<li>The project will present the organization of Birdability®, which promotes a welcoming, safe, and accessible environment for birding activities. It will dive into the maps, data sets and other statistics that are related to accessible bird watching in the United States, Canada, and potentially other countries (if data is available). The importance of birding and its benefits for research, conservation and human health will also be discussed in depth. </li>

					<p>
						There will also be a component in which I will input my own data from a park in Montreal<br>

						The research essay will feature:<br>

						<li>Bird watching and its benefits</li>
						<li>Information on Birdability® organization and their goal</li>
						<li>Definition of Accessibility</li>
						<li>How to assess a park for accessibility</li>
						<li>Show maps of accessibility in parks</li>
						<li>Make my own maps from data available on Birdability®</li>
						<li>Present accessibility data of Morgan Arboretum</li><br>

						<i>There will also be a component of mapping disability across Montreal and seeing which parks would be most interesting to make accessible for birdwatching, but also for other environmental activities. The data will be based on the Statistics Canada Population Census from 2016.</i>
